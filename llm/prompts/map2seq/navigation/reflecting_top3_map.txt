### Task Description ###
Given Navigation Task, Records of decision-making and observation information during the navigation and a Exploration Map. Deeply understand Navigation Task and identify up to 3 actions that could lead to a navigational error.

### Note ###
The following principles must be followed in making judgments:
1. In the Exploration Map, gray=roads, white=unexplored, blue dots=landmarks observed during explorationthe, names of landmarks corresponding to the numbers are indicated in "Map Legend" (if they are not in the map, they were not observed;markers are only approximate and not accurate, they only indicate that the landmark can be observed here), red line=navigational route.
2. The Exploration Map is drawn based on "Records of decision-making and observation information during the navigation", which simplifies the redundant "landmark information" during navigation and retains only approximate landmark locations. The 'Landmark Information' may be inaccurate, but the representation of intersections ('Intersection' field, multiple extensions of a road) is accurate.
3. T-intersection is equivalent to a 3-way intersection, and an intersection is equivalent to all types of intersections. Intersections are equipped with traffic lights, so the description of 'light' in the "Navigation Task" is equivalent to an Intersection.
4. Due to errors in visual observation, sometimes "Records of decision-making and observation information during the navigation" do not provide accurate 'Landmark Information' (i.e., there was originally a relevant landmark here but it was not observed due to errors, resulting in the relevant 'Landmark Information' not being written here in  "Records of decision-making and observation information during the navigation"), but 'Intersection Information' was determined to be correct.
5. Step by step, correlate the "Records of decision-making and observation information during the navigation" and the Exploration Map with the "Navigation Task" to identify the action that causes an error.
6. There are three main types of errors, one is when there are two turn actions after some "intersection information" and the second turn action is the wrong action. The other is when the final "stop" action stops too soon, when "stop" is wrong. Another is that the "stop" is executed too late, causing it to cross the destination, and the action at the position where it should have stopped is wrong.
7. When looking for errors, first check the number of 'Intersection Information' in the "Records of decision-making and observation information during the navigation" and the Exploration Map, and whether the subsequent action is consistent with the descriptions in the "Navigation Task" (regardless of whether the types of intersections match, only corresponding to the number of intersections).
8. Error actions should be judged primarily on the basis of 'Intersection Information'. When judging an error to be a turning action, carefully combine it with the course of the previous task and select it as an error point only when particularly sure.
9. If the stop is too early, then the error is the last "stop" action, and you need to suggest a few steps forward; if the stop is too late, then you need to find the correct stopping place from the action before the "stop" (within a range of 8 steps, not too far forward), and then treat it as an error action, and suggest to stop here.
10. When the number of intersections in the "Records of decision-making and observation information during the navigation" and the Exploration Map and the actions taken after the intersections are exactly the same as the descriptions in the "Navigation Task", and the 'Landmark Information' in "Records of decision-making and observation information during the navigation" is generally consistent with that in the Navigation Task, it is straightforward to determine that it is an error to stop at the wrong position. The position only needs to be further judged whether it was stopped early or late, without looking for other errors. (If it's hard to find what went wrong, you can just judge it as STOP too early)
11. After an intersection, there can only be one turning action. If two consecutive turning actions are found after a certain intersection, it can be determined that the second turning action is the erroneous action, and it's suggested to correct it to "forward". When the number of steps exceeds 50 then there is a high probability that the stop is too late, and you need to carefully proofread the content of the descriptions of the last two tasks and the "Records of decision-making and observation information during the navigation" to select the action that may have been wrong before "stop" (not too far away) as the point of error.
12. If there are fewer than three possible errors, simply provide the ones that exist without forcing three to be made up so as not to mislead subsequent operations. If there are more than three possible errors, provide the three most likely errors.
13. Your answer must be written strictly in the format, with no extra sentences:
"reason": "Judgmental basis", "top n": "Action sequence that could lead to a navigation error";
