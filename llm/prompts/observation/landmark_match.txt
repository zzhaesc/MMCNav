### Task ###
Provide a description of the five directions of observation of your current location, and the key landmarks or text to be judged. You are to determine which direction of observation description the given landmark is on (left or left front or front or right front or right) based on the associated building and text in the description of the observation in each direction. 

### Note ###
1. Answer whichever direction of observation the relevant buildings and text are on, or 'No' if they are not present.
2. Observations of text can be erroneous due to visual errors, so you can determine the presence of text if it is roughly similar.
3. Look up each direction carefully, step by step, and never answer the direction you are in incorrectly.
4. Your Answer must be strictly formatted as follows: 
"given key landmarks": "location or no".

### Example 1 ###
Key Landmarks:
Starbucks
a hotel

Observations:
Observations in the left: 
the image depicts a city park with a variety of buildings in the background. There is a large, multi-story building with a white facade and numerous windows, which could be an apartment or office building. Adjacent to it is another structure that appears to be a smaller, possibly residential building with a similar architectural style. In the foreground, there is a kiosk with an orange base and a gray top, which might serve as an information booth or a small shop. The park itself has several metal tables and chairs arranged for visitors to sit and relax. There are also some potted plants and trees scattered throughout the area, providing greenery and shade. The presence of these elements suggests that this is a public space designed for leisure and recreation within an urban environment.
Observations in the left front: 
the image depicts a bustling urban scene with several tall buildings in the background. The architecture of these buildings varies, with some featuring modern glass facades and others displaying more traditional designs with numerous windows and balconies. In the foreground, there is a wide pedestrian area lined with tables and chairs, suggesting the presence of an outdoor dining or gathering space. There are also large planters with greenery, adding a touch of nature to the urban environment. The street is busy with pedestrians walking along the sidewalk, and traffic lights indicate a controlled intersection. Based on the presence of these elements, it can be inferred that this location is likely a commercial or business district within a city, where people come to dine, work, or conduct various activities.
Observations directly front: 
the image depicts a bustling urban street scene with a focus on commercial buildings and street vendors. There are several storefronts visible, including one with the name "STARBUCKS" prominently displayed above the entrance. The architecture of the buildings suggests a mix of modern and possibly historic styles, with large windows and a stone facade. In front of these buildings, there are multiple street vendors with colorful umbrellas, indicating a lively marketplace or food court area. The presence of pedestrians walking by and engaging with the vendors suggests that this is a popular spot for locals and tourists alike. The overall atmosphere appears to be vibrant and active, typical of a busy city center.
Observations in the right front: 
The image depicts a bustling urban street scene with a focus on commercial buildings and street vendors. There are several storefronts visible, including one with the name "ARTMUSEUM" prominently displayed above the entrance. The architecture of the buildings suggests a mix of modern and possibly historic styles, with large windows and a stone facade. In front of these buildings, there are multiple street vendors with colorful umbrellas, indicating a lively marketplace or food court area. The presence of pedestrians walking by and engaging with the vendors suggests that this is a popular spot for locals and tourists alike.
Observations in the right: 
The image depicts a busy urban scene centered around a subway entrance. The subway station is marked by a green metal fence with the word "Subway" prominently displayed on it, indicating its function as an underground transit point. Adjacent to the subway entrance are large, imposing buildings with classical architectural elements such as columns and arches. One of the buildings has a sign that reads "marriott", suggesting it is a hotel. Another building features a sign with the name "La Vara", which could be a restaurant or another commercial establishment. The presence of pedestrians, cars, and traffic lights suggests this area is a bustling part of the city, likely a commercial or business district. The combination of retail stores, hotels, and public transportation points to a well-developed urban environment designed for both leisure and business activities.
(Thinking Process: There were no buildings or text that functioned similarly to 'a hotel' in the observations, so the answer was "no". The "STARBUCKS" is observed in the "Observations directly front", so the answer is "front")
=>
Starbucks: front
a hotel: no

Observations in the left: 
the image depicts a bustling urban street scene with a variety of buildings and signs. In the foreground, there is a crosswalk with pedestrians waiting to cross. To the left, there's a building with a red awning and a sign that reads "WAXING EYELASH EXTENSIONS." Adjacent to it, another building has a large window displaying a black and white patterned facade. On the right side of the image, there's a street corner with a traffic light showing a red hand for pedestrians. A "No Left Turn" sign is visible above the traffic light. There are also bicycles in motion on the street, indicating an active bike lane. The overall atmosphere suggests a busy city environment with commercial establishments and pedestrian activity.
Observations in the left front: 
the image depicts a bustling urban street scene with multiple buildings. The architecture suggests a mix of residential and commercial structures, with the presence of fire escapes indicating older, possibly historic buildings. There is a P.C. Richerd & Son Electrenics, the storefront is under construction with scaffolding. The street is busy with pedestrians crossing at a crosswalk, and there are traffic lights controlling the flow of vehicles. A cyclist is also visible, indicating that the area supports various modes of transportation. The overall atmosphere suggests a typical day in a densely populated city neighborhood.
Observations directly front: 
the image depicts a bustling city street with tall buildings on both sides. The architecture of the buildings varies, with some featuring modern glass facades and others displaying more traditional brickwork. There are numerous pedestrians walking along the sidewalks, and traffic is flowing in both directions. The street is lined with various street signs and traffic lights, indicating a well-regulated urban environment. The presence of construction equipment suggests ongoing development or maintenance work in the area. The overall scene conveys a sense of a busy metropolitan area with a mix of commercial and residential structures.
Observations in the right front: 
the image depicts a bustling city street scene at the intersection of 6th Avenue. The buildings are tall and appear to be commercial or office spaces, with large windows and signage that is not clearly legible. There is a green street sign indicating "6 AV" hanging above the intersection. The architecture suggests an urban environment, possibly in a downtown area. The presence of multiple vehicles, including cars and trucks, indicates heavy traffic. Pedestrians are visible on the sidewalks, some waiting to cross the street, suggesting a busy time of day. The overall atmosphere is one of a typical day in a busy metropolitan area.
Observations in the right: 
the image depicts a bustling urban scene with a prominent building labeled "BEST BUY" on the right side. The architecture of the building suggests it is a commercial establishment, likely an electronics retailer given the brand name. In front of the store, there are several pedestrians walking on the sidewalk, indicating a busy area possibly in a downtown or commercial district. To the left, there is another building with a sign that reads "ONE WAY," suggesting a one-way street or lane. The presence of traffic lights and street signs indicates regulated traffic flow. The overall setting appears to be a busy city street with a mix of pedestrian and vehicular activity.
(Thinking Process: There were no buildings or text that functioned similarly to 'a park' and 'McDonald's' in the observations, so the answer was "no". On the "Observations in the left front", it can be clearly seen the text "P.C. Richaerd & Son Electrenics" that is similar to "P.C. Richard & Son Electronics", so it is judged to be present and the answer is "left front".)
=>
a park: no
McDonald's: no
P.C. Richard & Son Electronics: left front
