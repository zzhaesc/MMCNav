### Task ###
Provide a description of the eight directions of observation of your current location, and the key landmarks or text to be judged. You are to determine which direction of observation description the given landmark is on (left or left front or front or right front or right) based on the associated building and text in the description of the observation in each direction. Answer whichever direction of observation the relevant buildings and text are on, or 'No' if they are not present. Observations of text can be erroneous due to visual errors, so you can determine the presence of text if it is roughly similar (pedestrians and weather in the descriptions, etc., are not relevant to landmark).
Your Answer must be strictly formatted as follows: 
"given key landmarks": "location or no".

### Example 1 ###
Key Landmarks:
Starbucks
a hotel

Observations:
Observations in the left rear direction:
The image depicts a city square with an orange and gray kiosk, surrounded by greenery and trees. In the background, there are tall buildings, including one with a distinctive dark facade. The sky is overcast, suggesting a cloudy day.
Observations in the left: 
the image depicts a city park with a variety of buildings in the background. There is a large, multi-story building with a white facade and numerous windows, which could be an apartment or office building. Adjacent to it is another structure that appears to be a smaller, possibly residential building with a similar architectural style. In the foreground, there is a kiosk with an orange base and a gray top, which might serve as an information booth or a small shop. The park itself has several metal tables and chairs arranged for visitors to sit and relax. There are also some potted plants and trees scattered throughout the area, providing greenery and shade. The presence of these elements suggests that this is a public space designed for leisure and recreation within an urban environment.
Observations in the left front: 
the image depicts a bustling urban scene with several tall buildings in the background. The architecture of these buildings varies, with some featuring modern glass facades and others displaying more traditional designs with numerous windows and balconies. In the foreground, there is a wide pedestrian area lined with tables and chairs, suggesting the presence of an outdoor dining or gathering space. There are also large planters with greenery, adding a touch of nature to the urban environment. The street is busy with pedestrians walking along the sidewalk, and traffic lights indicate a controlled intersection. Based on the presence of these elements, it can be inferred that this location is likely a commercial or business district within a city, where people come to dine, work, or conduct various activities.
Observations directly front: 
the image depicts a bustling urban street scene with a focus on commercial buildings and street vendors. There are several storefronts visible, including one with the name "STARBUCKS" prominently displayed above the entrance. The architecture of the buildings suggests a mix of modern and possibly historic styles, with large windows and a stone facade. In front of these buildings, there are multiple street vendors with colorful umbrellas, indicating a lively marketplace or food court area. The presence of pedestrians walking by and engaging with the vendors suggests that this is a popular spot for locals and tourists alike. The overall atmosphere appears to be vibrant and active, typical of a busy city center.
Observations in the right front: 
The image depicts a bustling urban street scene with a focus on commercial buildings and street vendors. There are several storefronts visible, including one with the name "ARTMUSEUM" prominently displayed above the entrance. The architecture of the buildings suggests a mix of modern and possibly historic styles, with large windows and a stone facade. In front of these buildings, there are multiple street vendors with colorful umbrellas, indicating a lively marketplace or food court area. The presence of pedestrians walking by and engaging with the vendors suggests that this is a popular spot for locals and tourists alike.
Observations in the right: 
The image depicts a busy urban scene centered around a subway entrance. The subway station is marked by a green metal fence with the word "Subway" prominently displayed on it, indicating its function as an underground transit point. Adjacent to the subway entrance are large, imposing buildings with classical architectural elements such as columns and arches. One of the buildings has a sign that reads "marriott", suggesting it is a hotel. Another building features a sign with the name "La Vara", which could be a restaurant or another commercial establishment. The presence of pedestrians, cars, and traffic lights suggests this area is a bustling part of the city, likely a commercial or business district. The combination of retail stores, hotels, and public transportation points to a well-developed urban environment designed for both leisure and business activities.
Observations in the right rear direction:
The image depicts a bustling urban street scene with a prominent building featuring large windows and a sign that reads "LUNA." In front of the building, there are several food carts with colorful umbrellas, one of which has a sign advertising "BAGELS" and another displaying a price of "$1.99." The street is lined with various storefronts, including one with a sign that says "TATTOO."
Observations directly rear:
The image features a street scene with a prominent building that has the name "Marimekko" displayed on its facade. The architecture of the building suggests it might be a commercial establishment, possibly a store or office for the Marimekko brand, which is known for its design and fashion products. In front of the building, there is a subway entrance with a green fence and a sign that reads "Subway." Additionally, there is a food cart with an umbrella to the left side of the image, indicating a bustling urban environment where people can grab quick bites while on the go.
(Thinking Process: There were no buildings or text that functioned similarly to 'a hotel' in the observations, so the answer was "no". The "STARBUCKS" is observed in the "Observations directly front", so the answer is "front")
=>
Starbucks: front
a hotel: no

(Thinking Process: There were no buildings or objects that functioned similarly to 'a park' and 'McDonald's' in the observations, so the answer was "no". On the left front observation, it can be clearly seen that "P.C. Richaerd & Son Electrenics" is similar to "P.C. Richard & Son Electronics", so it is judged to be present, and the answer is "left front".)
=>
a park: no
McDonald's: no
P.C. Richard & Son Electronics: left front
